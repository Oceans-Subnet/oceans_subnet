## 📌 1. Clarification

> 💡 **Important:** To mine on Oceans66 you don't need to run a miner. Validators will fetch your liquidity positions from the coldkey you registered with.

## 🎯 2. High‑Level Miner Role

### 1️⃣ **Neuron Registration**

- You register a _neuron_ on Subnet 66 using your **coldkey** and **hotkey**.
- In SN66 a single coldkey will hold the liquidity positions

### 2️⃣ **Liquidity Provision**

- After registration, your primary duty is **to supply liquidity** to Bittensor subnet pools.
- You are free to allocate funds wherever you believe yields the best economic result, rewards scale with how closely your allocations match the _community‑voted_ weight vector published by holders of the governance token **sn66 α‑Stake**.

### 3️⃣ **Reward Collection**

- At the end of every **epoch** the subnet measures:
  - 📊 **Your total liquidity** (USD value) in each eligible pool.
  - ⚖️ **The weight** assigned to each pool by α‑Stake voting.
- Rewards flow back to the **same hotkey** that owns your neuron

### 4️⃣ **Continuous Adjustment**

- Because weights (community priorities) and market conditions both move, miners who **adapt fastest** usually capture a larger slice of emissions over time.

## 💡 3. Strategies for Effective Mining

### 📈 **Monitor Weight Changes Frequently**

The most common reason for under‑performance is sticking to yesterday's allocation when the community has shifted focus elsewhere.

### 🌐 **Diversify When in Doubt**

Holding a balanced basket of pools can hedge against sudden weight rotations.
